And, to our satisfaction, we observe that their average battery life is longer than it was before using the new method. \n",

All parts must agree that the way the sample mean was obtained is correct. In the example we had $\\bar X = 2.65h$.

    "\n",
    "+ The `statsmodels` library in Python contains functions that help us work with these power equations. For example, if we are testing for the mean using the Student's $t$ distribution (or the $Z$ since they agree whenever $Z$ can really be used) then we can use the `tt.solvepower` function from that module. The way this works is the following. The function has four parameters (and an additional one called `alternative` to decide if we are doing a two-sided or one-sided test):  \n",
    "\n",
    "    + `nobs`, the number of observations or sample size, that we usually call $n$ in these notes.\n",
    "    + `alpha`, the value of $\\alpha$ with the meaning we know.\n",
    "    + `power`, which is $1 - \\beta$ as we know.\n",
    "    + `effect_size`; be careful with this one, it is the *standardized* effect size, meaning that it equals $\\delta / \\sigma$ with our notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Now, you provide the function with exactly three of these four parameters and the function will solve the power equation for the remaining one and return this as output. Typical use cases are:\n",
    "  + Finding the power of a test that you are planning or have already conducted.\n",

In Genomics, for example, it is very often the case that tens of thousands of hypothesis are tested (one test for each gene in the genome).  In such circumstances using a Bonferroni-like correction would be too drastic: we would reject too few of the nulls, leaving no room for scientific discovery. Thus we need some sort of balance between false discoveries and no discoveries at all. You can read more about this subject in this introductory   [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family-wise_error_rate). "

    "\n",
    "+ Besides the technical issue of multiple testing and the ethical problems of p-hacking, there is an ongoing debate in the academic world about the use of the p-value in general and the 0.05 threshold in particular.  [Many authors have expressed their concerns](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22375) about the way that the *p-value < 0.05* framework has made its way into becoming an often blindly applied rule to accept a result as a novel contribution. One of the key issues here is the distinction between being statistically significant and having some kind of scientific relevance. The following example may help understand this point.\n",

We want to examine that claim, so we take a random sample of $n = 50$ tablets and find a sample mean diameter $\\bar X = 13.05$mm with a standard deviation $s = 0.6$mm. We use this sample to perform a bilateral test of the null hypothesis $H_0:\\{\\mu = 13\\}$."

And that is hardly going to be of any practical relevance in any problem regarding the size of the tablets, their handling, packaging, dose content, etc. The idea in this example is that any effect, no matter how tiny and irrelevant, can be made statistically significant by taking a large enough sample.

The first piece of advice is **always check with an expert!** Data Scientists often work assisting experts in other fields and their judgment about the relevance of any finding should be our primary compass. But if you want to have a preliminary idea, you can use e.g. the indicator known as **Cohen's d**. For the hypothesis test about the mean of a single population it is defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\quad\\\\\n",
    "d = \\dfrac{\\bar X - \\mu_0}{s}\n",
    "\\quad\\\\\n",

    "    + A value $d < 0.2$ indicates that the difference is probably not relevant. \n",
    "    + On the other hand, if $d > 0.8$  then the difference is usually relevant.\n",
    "    + For intermediate values $0.2 < d < 0.8$ you should always check with *expert opinion* as we said before  to judge the relevance of your findings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Another way to help mitigate the problem of relevance is by **shifting the focus from the testing of hypothesis to the estimation of values**. That is, instead of (or besides) testing a null about the mean, always include a confidence interval estimation about the mean value. "
