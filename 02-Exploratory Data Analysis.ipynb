That means that the values of these variables are *numbers that have been measured in a meaningful scale, such that the operations with this numbers have meaning*. Numeric variables are further divided into **Discrete** and **Continuous** variables. We will discuss this with detail below.\n",
    "    + **Qualitative Variables or Factors**. The values of these variables are *labels* and they are used to *group the observations into classes*. A typical example would be grouping bird observations into species. The name of a species is a label, but it makes no sense to sum (or take the mean of) an ostrich and a sparrow. Even if the labels are sometimes numeric, operations have no sensible interpretation in relation with the data (we will see however an exception for binary variables when discussing proportions).  \n",

For example, when counting the coins in your wallet it makes no sense to say you have 3.5 coins. You may have 3 or 4, but no \"fraction of a coin\" counts as a coin.\n",

    "+ We will first consider variables that are clearly treated as continuous in the data set. For example, the `C` variable in `X` was designed that way. For such a variable, frequency tables make no sense. Most values of such variables will appear only once in the table, making almost every absolute frequency equal to 1. We need a different set of tools for these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The simplest idea is to reduce the continuous variables to discrete ones using `binning`. That is we divide all  values of the variable into *bins*, which are a collection of intervals that span all possible values. In our present example, the variable `C` was designed to take random values in the $[-4, 4]$ interval. Thus we will divide that interval into a collection of subintervals or bins. How many bins? Well, that is not a simple question, because the answer depends on both the specific data and what you are trying to accomplish. A rule of thumb is not to use less than five bins and no more than $\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of data points for your variable. In our case we will divide $[-4, 4]$ into eight subintervals or bins and we will assign each value of `C` to the corresponding subinterval. We can do that with the pandas cut function. We will first apply it naïvely to the variable and see what happens:"

Not only the frequency table is too big to be useful. There is also the fact that the information it provides is, in this format, less and less relevant. Think about this: does it make much of a difference if the number of derailed cars was 27 instead of 26? And that kind of problem gets only worse as the number of different values increases. At some point, the information that becomes relevant is not the particular value, but the interval it belongs to. The questions we care about are *binned questions*, such as: did the accident involve more than 10 but less than 20 cars? This gives us a better picture of the accident's severity, possible cost and damages, etc.\n",
